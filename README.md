## Local Development

Follow these steps to run the application in your local environment:

1. Clone this repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fork-commit-merge-web.git
    ```

2. Install the project dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd fork-commit-merge-web
    npm i
    ```

3. Set up your environment variables. You will need to create a MongoDB Atlas cluster and an AWS S3 bucket for your local development environment.

    First, make a copy of the `.env.local-example` file and rename it to `.env.local`.

    ```bash
    cp .env.local-example .env.local
    ```

    You will need to replace the placeholder values in this file with your actual credentials.

    - For [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), you will need to replace `MONGODB_URI` with your MongoDB connection string. You can get this from the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Also, remember to add `0.0.0.0/0` to the Network Access to allow connections from all IP addresses.

    - For [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), you will need to replace `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` with your actual bucket name and AWS S3 credentials. You can get these from the AWS Management Console. For the Permissions overview, make sure to set the access to public and turn "Block all public access" off. Add the following to the Bucket policy (replace "your-bucket-name" with your actual bucket name):

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "PublicReadGet",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:PutObject",
                    "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "s3:GetObjectVersion"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    And add the following to CORS:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
            "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
            "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
    ]
    ```

4. Run the development server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Roadmap

The following are some of the enhancements and features planned for future releases of this project. We welcome any feedback or contributions to help make these plans a reality.

1. User Authentication: We plan to add user registration and login functionality. This will allow users to have personalized experiences and save their projects on the platform.

2. Pro Membership: We're considering a paid membership tier. Pro members would receive certain benefits, such as a special 'Pro' badge and early access to new features. More details about the cost and specific benefits will be provided at a later date.

3. Integration with GitHub API: To make project management easier, we're planning on adding the ability to pull project information directly from GitHub. This would streamline the process of adding new projects to the site.

These roadmap items are subject to change based on user feedback and development resources. If you have any suggestions or if you want to contribute to the project, please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section.
